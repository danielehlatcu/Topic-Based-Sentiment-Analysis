# Topic-Based-Sentiment-Analysis
Online reviews are a great source of information for both consumers and sellers: the former can be guided by the opinions of others, with whom they can weigh their decisions; the latter can use these opinions to monitor the performance of the product and, if necessary, improve aspects of it. 

However, with the spread of the Internet, the reviews accompanying each good have become overwhelming in terms of numbers and information, making it impossible to fully understand what is being discussed, unless you waste a lot of time. 

In addition, the various rating systems that have developed on the different sites are also sometimes misleading and oversimplifying, with, for example, positive ratings hiding negative information in the text, or extremely negative ratings associated with only minor flaws. 

For these motives, it has become of paramount importance for all companies and organisations to develop methods that can quickly and accurately extract and analyse relevant information from a text. One such technique is Topic Based Sentiment Analysis. This technique attempts to identify the most discussed topics or themes within a text, and then assesses the writer's opinion on these aspects.

The aim of this project is to go beyond the average rating associated with the product in order to determine, in more depth, the opinions of users. In order to achieve this goal, I analysed phones reviews, in order to identify which aspects were the most important in the process of choosing and evaluating the product and the sentiment regarding each topic.
